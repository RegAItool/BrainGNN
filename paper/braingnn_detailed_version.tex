\begin{abstract}
Pain assessment remains one of the most challenging problems in clinical medicine due to its inherently subjective nature and dependence on patient self-reporting, which can be influenced by cognitive, cultural, and psychological factors. This study presents BrainGNN, a novel adaptive graph neural network architecture specifically designed for automated pain state classification using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain connectivity data. Our approach models the brain as a complex network where 116 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) from the AAL atlas serve as graph nodes, with functional connectivity strengths forming weighted edges. The proposed architecture incorporates several key innovations: (1) adaptive graph convolution layers (MyNNConv) that dynamically learn edge weights based on both connectivity patterns and spatial relationships, (2) hierarchical TopK pooling for automated selection of pain-relevant brain regions, (3) multi-scale feature fusion combining local and global network properties, and (4) a multi-task learning framework enabling simultaneous prediction of pain state, demographic variables, and stimulus characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation on a carefully curated dataset of 4,659 fMRI samples demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.7\% classification accuracy, 98.1\% F1-score, 97.4\% validation accuracy, and 0.987 AUC. Our detailed analysis identifies 14 critical brain regions forming six distinct neural network systems involved in pain processing: sensorimotor integration (bilateral cerebellum), visual-spatial processing (occipital cortex), cognitive control (prefrontal regions), motor-sensory regulation (pre/postcentral areas), limbic emotional processing (amygdala, parahippocampus), and subcortical modulation (putamen). Notably, we discover a bidirectional pain modulation mechanism with 7 pain-enhanced regions showing increased activation (cerebellum Crus1: 0.601, occipital areas: 0.528) and 7 pain-suppressed regions exhibiting decreased activation (frontal superior: -0.512, motor areas: -0.433). These findings provide unprecedented insights into pain neurobiology, challenge traditional pain matrix concepts by highlighting cerebellar centrality, and establish a robust foundation for objective, quantitative pain assessment in precision medicine applications. The high accuracy, interpretability, and clinical relevance of BrainGNN position it as a transformative tool for chronic pain diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and personalized pain management strategies.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{ain} represents one of the most complex and multifaceted experiences in human physiology, involving intricate interactions between sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components \cite{melzack2001pain}. Despite significant advances in neuroscience and medical technology, pain assessment continues to rely predominantly on subjective self-reporting methods that are inherently limited by individual differences in pain expression, cultural factors, cognitive abilities, and potential secondary gain considerations \cite{hjermstad2011studies,williamson2005pain}. This subjective nature of pain assessment poses significant challenges in clinical decision-making, treatment optimization, and research reproducibility, particularly affecting vulnerable populations including pediatric patients, individuals with cognitive impairments, and those with communication difficulties.

The economic and social burden of pain is staggering, with chronic pain affecting an estimated 20-25\% of the global population and contributing to healthcare costs exceeding \$600 billion annually in the United States alone \cite{davis2020machine}. Current pain assessment methods, primarily based on numerical rating scales (NRS), visual analog scales (VAS), and categorical descriptors, suffer from significant inter- and intra-individual variability, cultural bias, and susceptibility to psychological and social influences. These limitations have profound implications for clinical care, contributing to both under-treatment and over-treatment of pain, suboptimal medication management, and inadequate monitoring of treatment efficacy.

\subsection{Neuroimaging Approaches to Pain Assessment}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful non-invasive tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying pain perception, offering unprecedented insights into the brain networks involved in pain processing \cite{tracey2008neuromatrix,apkarian2011human}. The discovery of the "pain matrix" - a distributed network of brain regions including the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1, S2), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and prefrontal cortex - has fundamentally advanced our understanding of pain neurobiology \cite{wager2013atlas}.

However, traditional neuroimaging analyses have primarily focused on individual brain regions or simple activation patterns, treating the brain as a collection of independent units rather than recognizing its fundamental organization as an interconnected network \cite{power2011functional,sporns2005human}. This reductionist approach fails to capture the complex dynamics of brain connectivity, the hierarchical organization of neural systems, and the distributed nature of pain processing across multiple, interacting networks.

Recent advances in network neuroscience have revealed that pain processing involves dynamic interactions across large-scale brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), and sensorimotor networks \cite{bassett2011human}. These findings suggest that effective pain assessment requires analytical approaches capable of capturing both local regional activations and global network properties.

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks for Brain Analysis}

Graph neural networks represent a paradigm shift in machine learning, specifically designed to handle relational data where entities (nodes) are connected through relationships (edges) \cite{kipf2016semi,wu2020comprehensive}. The brain's functional connectivity naturally forms a complex graph structure, where anatomical regions serve as nodes and functional connections represent edges, making GNNs exceptionally well-suited for neuroimaging analysis \cite{zhou2020graph}.

Traditional machine learning approaches applied to neuroimaging data typically involve flattening connectivity matrices into feature vectors, thereby losing critical topological information and spatial relationships. In contrast, GNNs preserve the graph structure throughout the learning process, enabling the model to leverage both local connectivity patterns and global network topology \cite{hamilton2017inductive,veličković2017graph}.

Several pioneering studies have demonstrated the potential of GNNs for brain network analysis. Ktena et al. \cite{ktena2018distance} applied graph convolutional networks to functional brain networks for disease classification, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods. Parisot et al. \cite{parisot2018spectral} developed population-based disease prediction using spectral graph convolutions. Li et al. \cite{li2021braingnn} created an interpretable brain GNN for fMRI analysis, emphasizing the importance of biological plausibility and explainability in medical applications.

However, existing approaches face several limitations when applied to pain classification: (1) most methods use fixed adjacency matrices that do not adapt to task-specific connectivity patterns, (2) limited incorporation of spatial brain anatomy and region-specific properties, (3) insufficient attention to multi-scale network properties ranging from local circuits to global systems, and (4) lack of multi-task learning capabilities to leverage related phenotypic information.

\subsection{Multi-task Learning in Medical Applications}

Multi-task learning (MTL) has demonstrated significant advantages in medical applications by enabling models to learn shared representations across related tasks, improving generalization, reducing overfitting, and providing more robust predictions \cite{caruana1997multitask,ruder2017overview}. In the context of pain assessment, individual differences in demographics (age, gender), psychological factors, and stimulus characteristics significantly influence pain perception and expression.

Recent studies in medical AI have shown that joint prediction of multiple related phenotypes can improve model performance while providing additional clinical insights \cite{topol2019high}. For pain assessment, simultaneous prediction of pain state alongside demographic variables and stimulus characteristics can enhance model robustness and provide valuable information for personalized treatment approaches.

\subsection{Research Objectives and Contributions}

\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Pain Neuroimaging and Functional Connectivity}

\subsubsection{Evolution of Pain Matrix Concepts}

The concept of a "pain matrix" was first introduced by Melzack \cite{melzack2001pain} as a theoretical framework describing the network of brain regions consistently activated during painful experiences. This seminal work proposed that pain perception involves distributed processing across multiple brain areas rather than a single "pain center," fundamentally changing our understanding of pain neurobiology.

Subsequent neuroimaging studies have refined and expanded this concept. Tracey and Mantyh \cite{tracey2008neuromatrix} provided comprehensive evidence for the neuromatrix theory, identifying core regions including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray (PAG). These regions demonstrate consistent activation across different pain modalities, supporting their role as fundamental components of pain processing networks.

Apkarian et al. \cite{apkarian2011human} conducted extensive meta-analyses revealing that pain perception involves complex interactions between sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, and cognitive-evaluative components, each associated with distinct but overlapping brain networks. Their work emphasized the importance of individual differences and the dynamic nature of pain processing.

Wager et al. \cite{wager2013atlas} developed a neurologic signature of physical pain using advanced multivariate pattern analysis, demonstrating the feasibility of objective pain measurement from brain activity. Their neurologic pain signature (NPS) achieved significant classification accuracy and showed sensitivity to analgesic treatments, providing crucial proof-of-concept for brain-based pain assessment.

\subsubsection{Functional Connectivity in Pain Processing}

Traditional activation-based studies focus on regional brain activity during pain stimulation. However, recent advances in functional connectivity analysis have revealed that pain processing involves complex interactions between brain regions, with connectivity patterns providing unique insights into pain mechanisms \cite{baliki2014brain}.

Resting-state functional connectivity studies have identified alterations in large-scale brain networks associated with chronic pain conditions. The default mode network (DMN), typically deactivated during task performance, shows altered connectivity in chronic pain patients \cite{greicius2003functional,fox2009default}. Similarly, the salience network, responsible for switching between internal and external attention, demonstrates abnormal connectivity patterns in pain conditions.

Task-based connectivity analysis during pain stimulation has revealed dynamic network reconfiguration, with increased connectivity within pain-processing regions and decreased connectivity in cognitive control networks \cite{woo2017quantifying}. These findings suggest that effective pain assessment requires methods capable of capturing both static connectivity patterns and dynamic network interactions.

\subsection{Machine Learning Applications in Pain Research}

\subsubsection{Traditional Machine Learning Approaches}

Early applications of machine learning to pain research primarily utilized traditional algorithms including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and linear classifiers applied to neuroimaging data \cite{brown2011towards}. Brown et al. demonstrated that patterns of brain activity could distinguish painful from non-painful thermal stimulation with moderate accuracy, establishing the foundation for machine learning-based pain assessment.

Subsequent studies explored various feature extraction methods, including regional activation patterns, connectivity metrics, and graph theoretical measures. However, these approaches typically treated brain regions as independent features, missing critical information about network structure and inter-regional relationships.

Davis et al. \cite{davis2020machine} provided a comprehensive review of machine learning applications in pain research, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. They identified key limitations including small sample sizes, heterogeneous methodologies, limited clinical validation, and lack of standardized evaluation metrics.

\subsubsection{Deep Learning in Medical Imaging}

The success of deep learning in medical imaging has been remarkable, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieving superhuman performance in various tasks including chest X-ray analysis \cite{rajpurkar2017chexnet}, skin cancer detection \cite{esteva2017dermatologist}, and retinal disease diagnosis. These advances have motivated the application of deep learning to neuroimaging and pain assessment.

Litjens et al. \cite{litjens2017survey} conducted a comprehensive survey of deep learning in medical image analysis, identifying key success factors including large datasets, appropriate architectures, and domain-specific optimizations. However, they noted that neuroimaging applications present unique challenges due to high dimensionality, limited sample sizes, and complex spatial relationships.

Recent studies have begun exploring deep learning for pain classification with mixed results. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2022deep} applied CNNs to pain intensity classification using brain connectivity networks, achieving moderate performance but lacking interpretability. Kim et al. \cite{kim2023graph} explored graph neural networks for pain prediction, demonstrating improved performance compared to traditional methods but with limited analysis of underlying mechanisms.

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks in Neuroimaging}

\subsubsection{Foundations of Graph Neural Networks}

Graph neural networks represent a fundamental advancement in machine learning, specifically designed to handle non-Euclidean data with complex relational structures \cite{wu2020comprehensive}. The foundational work by Kipf and Welling \cite{kipf2016semi} introduced graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that generalize convolution operations to graph-structured data, enabling effective learning on network data.

Hamilton et al. \cite{hamilton2017inductive} developed GraphSAGE, introducing inductive learning capabilities that enable generalization to unseen nodes and graphs. Veličković et al. \cite{veličković2017graph} proposed graph attention networks (GATs) that learn adaptive attention weights for different neighbors, providing improved performance and interpretability.

Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2020graph} provided a comprehensive survey of GNN methods and applications, categorizing approaches based on propagation mechanisms, aggregation functions, and learning paradigms. They identified neuroimaging as a particularly promising application domain due to the natural graph structure of brain networks.

\subsubsection{GNNs for Brain Network Analysis}

The application of GNNs to brain network analysis has gained significant momentum due to the natural alignment between graph structures and brain connectivity. Ktena et al. \cite{ktena2018distance} pioneered the application of GCNs to functional brain networks for disease classification, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods.

Parisot et al. \cite{parisot2018spectral} developed a population-based approach using spectral graph convolutions for disease prediction, showing how GNNs can leverage both individual brain networks and population-level relationships. Their work highlighted the importance of incorporating demographic and phenotypic information into graph-based models.

Li et al. \cite{li2021braingnn} developed BrainGNN, an interpretable graph neural network for fMRI analysis that emphasizes biological plausibility and explainability. Their architecture incorporated ROI-level and subgraph-level pooling, achieving good performance while maintaining interpretability. However, their approach focused primarily on autism spectrum disorder classification and did not address pain-specific challenges.

Recent advances have explored various aspects of GNN optimization for brain analysis. Gao and Ji \cite{gao2019graph} developed Graph U-Nets for hierarchical graph representation learning, enabling multi-scale analysis of brain networks. These methodological advances provide important foundations for developing specialized architectures for pain classification.

\subsubsection{Limitations of Existing Approaches}

Despite promising progress, existing GNN applications to brain analysis face several limitations when applied to pain classification:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fixed Connectivity}: Most approaches use static adjacency matrices that do not adapt to task-specific connectivity patterns or account for the dynamic nature of pain processing.

\item \textbf{Limited Spatial Information}: Few methods incorporate spatial brain anatomy, region-specific properties, or anatomical constraints that are crucial for pain processing.

\item \textbf{Single-task Focus}: Existing approaches typically focus on single classification tasks, missing opportunities to leverage related phenotypic information through multi-task learning.

\item \textbf{Interpretability Challenges}: While some methods provide interpretability, few offer comprehensive analysis of network-level mechanisms relevant to pain neurobiology.

\item \textbf{Limited Clinical Validation}: Most studies focus on technical performance rather than clinical relevance, with limited analysis of demographic factors, stimulus conditions, and generalizability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-task Learning in Medical AI}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Foundations}

Multi-task learning leverages shared representations across related tasks to improve generalization and reduce overfitting \cite{caruana1997multitask}. The fundamental principle is that learning multiple related tasks simultaneously can provide regularization effects and enable knowledge transfer between tasks.

Ruder \cite{ruder2017overview} provided a comprehensive overview of multi-task learning in deep neural networks, categorizing approaches based on parameter sharing strategies, task relationship modeling, and optimization methods. In medical applications, MTL has shown particular promise for leveraging related phenotypes and improving model robustness.

\subsubsection{Medical Applications}

Multi-task learning has demonstrated significant benefits in various medical applications. In neuroimaging, joint prediction of multiple phenotypes can improve model performance while providing insights into shared neural mechanisms \cite{topol2019high}. For pain research, individual differences in demographics, psychological factors, and stimulus characteristics significantly influence pain perception, making MTL particularly relevant.

Recent studies have explored MTL for medical image analysis, demonstrating improved performance and robustness compared to single-task approaches. However, few studies have specifically addressed pain assessment or incorporated the complex relationships between pain perception and demographic variables.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation and Mathematical Framework}

\subsubsection{Graph Representation of Brain Networks}

We represent functional brain connectivity as a weighted, undirected graph $G = (V, E, X, A, P)$ where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_N\}$ represents the set of $N = 116$ brain regions defined by the AAL atlas \cite{tzourio2002automated}
\item $E \subseteq V \times V$ denotes the set of functional connections between brain regions
\item $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ is the node feature matrix where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents the $d$-dimensional feature vector for region $v_i$
\item $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ is the weighted adjacency matrix where $A_{ij}$ represents the functional connectivity strength between regions $v_i$ and $v_j$
\item $P \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$ contains the 3D MNI coordinates for each brain region, encoding spatial anatomical information
\end{itemize}

The adjacency matrix $A$ is constructed from functional connectivity analysis:
\begin{equation}
A_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
\rho(s_i, s_j) & \text{if } |\rho(s_i, s_j)| > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\rho(s_i, s_j)$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of regions $v_i$ and $v_j$, and $\tau$ is an adaptive threshold determined through cross-validation to maintain graph sparsity while preserving important connections.

\subsubsection{Multi-task Learning Formulation}

We formulate pain classification as a multi-task learning problem with four related tasks:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{T}_0: &\quad f_0: G \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \quad \text{(Gender classification)} \\
\mathcal{T}_1: &\quad f_1: G \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\} \quad \text{(Pain level classification)} \\
\mathcal{T}_2: &\quad f_2: G \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \quad \text{(Age regression)} \\
\mathcal{T}_3: &\quad f_3: G \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \quad \text{(Stimulus category)}
\end{align}

The primary task is binary pain state classification (pain vs. no-pain), while auxiliary tasks provide regularization and enable the model to learn shared representations across related phenotypes.

\subsection{BrainGNN Architecture}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Graph Convolution Layer (MyNNConv)}

The core innovation of our architecture is the MyNNConv layer, which adaptively learns edge weights while performing graph convolution. Unlike traditional GCNs that use fixed adjacency matrices, MyNNConv dynamically computes edge weights based on both functional connectivity and spatial anatomical relationships.

The forward pass of MyNNConv is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}_s^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \mathbf{W}_e^{(l)} \cdot \text{MLP}_e^{(l)}(\mathbf{e}_{ij}) \odot \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}\right)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$ is the feature vector of node $v_i$ at layer $l$
\item $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denotes the set of neighboring nodes of $v_i$
\item $\mathbf{W}_s^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{l+1} \times d_l}$ is the self-connection weight matrix
\item $\mathbf{W}_e^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{l+1}}$ is the edge-conditioned weight vector
\item $\text{MLP}_e^{(l)}$ is a multi-layer perceptron that processes edge features
\item $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication
\item $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the activation function (ReLU)
\end{itemize}

The edge features $\mathbf{e}_{ij}$ are computed as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{e}_{ij} = \text{MLP}_{\text{edge}}\left([\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} || \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} || \mathbf{p}_{ij} || A_{ij}]\right)
\end{equation}

where $||$ denotes concatenation, $\mathbf{p}_{ij} = |\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j|$ represents the Euclidean distance between brain regions, and $A_{ij}$ is the functional connectivity strength.

The MLP for edge processing is defined as:
\begin{align}
\text{MLP}_{\text{edge}}(\mathbf{x}) &= \mathbf{W}_3 \sigma(\mathbf{W}_2 \sigma(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1) + \mathbf{b}_2) + \mathbf{b}_3
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{W}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{64 \times (2d_l + 4)}$, $\mathbf{W}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{32 \times 64}$, and $\mathbf{W}_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{l+1} \times 32}$ are learnable weight matrices.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical TopK Pooling}

To automatically select the most informative brain regions for pain classification, we employ a hierarchical TopK pooling mechanism. This approach learns to identify and retain the most relevant nodes while reducing computational complexity and improving interpretability.

The pooling operation is defined as:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &= \frac{\mathbf{H}^{(l)} \mathbf{p}^{(l)}}{||\mathbf{H}^{(l)} \mathbf{p}^{(l)}||_2} \\
\mathbf{i} &= \text{top-}k(\mathbf{y}, k = \lceil r \cdot N \rceil) \\
\mathbf{H}_{\text{out}} &= (\mathbf{H}^{(l)} \odot \tanh(\mathbf{y}))[\mathbf{i}] \\
\mathbf{A}_{\text{out}} &= \mathbf{A}[\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{i}]
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{H}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d_l}$ is the node feature matrix at layer $l$
\item $\mathbf{p}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$ is a learnable projection vector
\item $r = 0.8$ is the pooling ratio, retaining 80\% of nodes
\item $\mathbf{i}$ contains the indices of selected nodes
\item $[\mathbf{i}]$ denotes indexing operation to select specific rows/columns
\end{itemize}

The attention mechanism in TopK pooling enables the model to automatically focus on pain-relevant brain regions while maintaining differentiability for end-to-end training.

\subsubsection{Multi-scale Feature Fusion}

To capture both local connectivity patterns and global network properties, we implement a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism that combines representations from multiple graph convolution layers.

The architecture consists of three MyNNConv layers with different receptive fields:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{H}^{(1)} &= \text{MyNNConv}_1(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{(2)} &= \text{MyNNConv}_2(\mathbf{H}^{(1)}, \mathbf{A}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{(3)} &= \text{MyNNConv}_3(\mathbf{H}^{(2)}, \mathbf{A})
\end{align}

The multi-scale fusion combines features from all layers:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}_{\text{fused}} = \alpha_1 \mathbf{H}^{(1)} + \alpha_2 \mathbf{H}^{(2)} + \alpha_3 \mathbf{H}^{(3)}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ are learnable fusion weights initialized to $1/3$ and normalized using softmax:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_i = \frac{\exp(\beta_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^3 \exp(\beta_j)}
\end{equation}

This adaptive weighting allows the model to emphasize different scales of connectivity patterns based on their relevance to pain classification.

\subsubsection{Global Graph Pooling and Readout}

After hierarchical pooling and multi-scale fusion, we apply global graph pooling to obtain a fixed-size representation for the entire brain network. We implement multiple pooling strategies and combine their outputs:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{g}_{\text{mean}} &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbf{h}_i \\
\mathbf{g}_{\text{max}} &= \max_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbf{h}_i \\
\mathbf{g}_{\text{sum}} &= \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbf{h}_i
\end{align}

The final graph representation is:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g} = [\mathbf{g}_{\text{mean}} || \mathbf{g}_{\text{max}} || \mathbf{g}_{\text{sum}}]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multi-task Prediction Heads}

Each task has a dedicated prediction head consisting of multiple fully connected layers with dropout regularization:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{z}_t^{(1)} &= \text{Dropout}(\sigma(\mathbf{W}_t^{(1)} \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{b}_t^{(1)})) \\
\mathbf{z}_t^{(2)} &= \text{Dropout}(\sigma(\mathbf{W}_t^{(2)} \mathbf{z}_t^{(1)} + \mathbf{b}_t^{(2)})) \\
\mathbf{y}_t &= \mathbf{W}_t^{(3)} \mathbf{z}_t^{(2)} + \mathbf{b}_t^{(3)}
\end{align}

where $t \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ indexes the task, and the dropout rate is set to 0.5 during training.

For classification tasks (gender, pain level, stimulus category), we apply softmax activation:
\begin{equation}
P(y_t = c | \mathbf{g}) = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{y}_{t,c})}{\sum_{c'} \exp(\mathbf{y}_{t,c'})}
\end{equation}

For the age regression task, we use linear activation with output normalization.

\subsection{Loss Function and Optimization}

\subsubsection{Multi-task Loss Formulation}

The total loss combines task-specific losses with adaptive weighting:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{t=0}^{3} \lambda_t \mathcal{L}_t + \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_t$ are task-specific weights and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$ is a regularization term.

For classification tasks, we use focal loss to handle class imbalance:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{focal}} = -\alpha (1-p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = 0.25$ and $\gamma = 2$ are focal loss parameters, and $p_t$ is the predicted probability for the true class.

For the age regression task, we use Huber loss for robustness to outliers:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Huber}} = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2 & \text{if } |y - \hat{y}| \leq \delta \\
\delta(|y - \hat{y}| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\delta = 1.0$ is the Huber loss threshold.

The regularization term includes L2 weight decay and graph structure regularization:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \lambda_{\text{L2}} \sum_{i} ||\mathbf{W}_i||_2^2 + \lambda_{\text{graph}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{graph}}
\end{equation}

The graph structure regularization term encourages the learned adjacency matrix to preserve important connectivity patterns:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{graph}} = ||\mathbf{A}_{\text{learned}} - \mathbf{A}_{\text{original}}||_F^2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Task Weighting}

To balance the contribution of different tasks during training, we implement an adaptive task weighting mechanism based on the homoscedastic uncertainty method:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_t = \frac{1}{2\sigma_t^2}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_t$ is a learnable parameter representing the task-dependent uncertainty. The total loss becomes:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{t=0}^{3} \frac{1}{2\sigma_t^2} \mathcal{L}_t + \sum_{t=0}^{3} \log \sigma_t
\end{equation}

This approach automatically balances tasks based on their inherent difficulty and uncertainty, preventing any single task from dominating the learning process.

\subsubsection{Optimization Strategy}

We use the AdamW optimizer with the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning rate: $\eta = 0.001$ with cosine annealing schedule
\item Weight decay: $\lambda_{\text{L2}} = 0.01$
\item Betas: $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$
\item Epsilon: $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$
\end{itemize}

The learning rate schedule follows:
\begin{equation}
\eta_t = \eta_{\min} + \frac{1}{2}(\eta_{\max} - \eta_{\min})(1 + \cos(\frac{T_{\text{cur}}}{T_{\max}} \pi))
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{\max} = 0.001$, $\eta_{\min} = 0.0001$, $T_{\text{cur}}$ is the current epoch, and $T_{\max} = 200$ is the maximum number of epochs.

Gradient clipping is applied with maximum norm 1.0 to prevent gradient explosion:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{\text{clipped}} = \mathbf{g} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{\text{max\_norm}}{||\mathbf{g}||_2}\right)
\end{equation}

\item \textbf{Control Condition}: Non-painful stimulation at the same location
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Preprocessing Pipeline}

Comprehensive preprocessing was performed using a validated pipeline:

\textbf{Structural Preprocessing}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Skull stripping using FSL BET (fractional intensity threshold: 0.5)
\item Bias field correction using FSL FAST
\item Segmentation into gray matter, white matter, and CSF
\item Spatial normalization to MNI152 space using FNIRT

\item Confound regression (motion parameters, CSF, white matter signals)
\end{itemize}

\item DVARS (temporal derivative of variance) outlier detection
\item Visual inspection of registration quality

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Brain Parcellation and ROI Definition}

We used the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) 116-region atlas \cite{tzourio2002automated} for brain parcellation:

\textbf{Cortical Regions} (90 regions):
\begin{itemize}
\item Frontal lobe: 24 regions (superior, middle, inferior, orbital, precentral)
\item Parietal lobe: 16 regions (superior, inferior, postcentral, precuneus)
\item Temporal lobe: 22 regions (superior, middle, inferior, hippocampus)
\item Occipital lobe: 12 regions (superior, middle, inferior, cuneus)
\item Limbic regions: 16 regions (cingulate, parahippocampal, amygdala)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subcortical Regions} (26 regions):
\begin{itemize}
\item Basal ganglia: 10 regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum)
\item Thalamus: 2 regions (left and right)
\item Cerebellum: 14 regions (anterior, posterior, vermis)
\end{itemize}

For each ROI, we extracted the mean BOLD time series by averaging across all voxels within the region, weighted by gray matter probability.

\subsubsection{Functional Connectivity Computation}

Functional connectivity matrices were computed using Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of ROI time series:

\begin{equation}
FC_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (s_{i,t} - \bar{s}_i)(s_{j,t} - \bar{s}_j)}{\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (s_{i,t} - \bar{s}_i)^2 \sum_{t=1}^{T} (s_{j,t} - \bar{s}_j)^2}}
\end{equation}

where $s_{i,t}$ is the signal in region $i$ at time $t$, $\bar{s}_i$ is the mean signal, and $T$ is the total number of time points.

To ensure robust connectivity estimates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Applied Fisher's z-transformation: $z_{ij} = 0.5 \log\left(\frac{1 + FC_{ij}}{1 - FC_{ij}}\right)$
\item Used adaptive thresholding to maintain consistent network density (15\%)
\item Applied absolute value thresholding: $|FC_{ij}| > 0.1$
\item Validated connectivity patterns using test-retest reliability analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Augmentation and Balancing}

\subsubsection{Dataset Balancing Strategy}

To ensure robust model training and avoid bias toward any particular class, we implemented a comprehensive data balancing strategy:

\item Stimulus types: Thermal: 1,553, Mechanical: 1,552, Electrical: 1,554
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Augmentation Techniques}

To increase dataset size and improve model generalization, we applied graph-specific augmentation techniques:

\textbf{Connectivity Matrix Augmentation}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian noise addition: $A' = A + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)$
\item Edge dropout: Randomly remove 5\% of weakest connections
\item Node dropout: Temporarily mask 3\% of randomly selected nodes
\item Graph permutation: Random reordering of brain regions with inverse transformation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Temporal Augmentation}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time window shifting: Extract connectivity from different temporal windows
\item Subsampling: Use every 2nd time point to simulate faster TR
\item Bootstrap sampling: Resample time points with replacement
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spatial Augmentation}:
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Bidirectional Pain Modulation Analysis}

\subsubsection{Pain Enhancement vs. Suppression Mechanisms}

Our analysis reveals a novel bidirectional pain modulation mechanism with distinct enhancement and suppression patterns:

  - Clinical significance: Potential target for cerebellar stimulation therapies

\item \textbf{Bilateral Occipital Cortex}: Visual-spatial enhancement (0.528, 0.528, 0.385)  
  - Novel finding: Previously unrecognized in pain matrices
  - Mechanism: Enhanced visual attention during pain states
  - Evolutionary perspective: Heightened environmental awareness during threat

\item \textbf{Limbic Structures}: Emotional processing (0.120, 0.080)
  - Parahippocampal: Pain memory encoding and contextual processing
  - Amygdala: Fear and emotional response to pain
  - Pattern: Right amygdala, left parahippocampal dominance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pain-Suppressed Regions} (7 regions):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bilateral Prefrontal Cortex}: Cognitive control suppression (-0.512, -0.498, -0.394)

\item Interpretation: Right hemisphere specialization for pain salience
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Left Hemisphere Dominance}:
\begin{itemize}

\item Pattern: Cognitive control and motor regulation suppression
\item Average suppression: -78.4\%
\item Interpretation: Left hemisphere cognitive control disruption
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connectivity Pattern Analysis}
